# Final bachelor engineering project: Filterd 
Fitering plugin for the open-source process mining software ProM 


In a team of 11 people that were subdivided in the front-end and back-end teams, we developed a plugin, that:

-  unifies the overalapping functionality of ProM filters into clearly defined system that is simple and easily extensible
-  modernizes the interface to match the workflow of process mining researchers 
-  brings the system of a computing "notebook" such as Jupyter to process mining
-  is documented extensively such that the contributors of ProM can easily use the predfined classes and methods
-  makes it easy to insert interface widgets without hassle just using the right deifnition in the backend

and all that while closely collaborating with our client Dirk Fahland, d.fahland@tue.nl, following the agile development principles with SCRUM. 

Our final product (which is however in a different repository) was described as "professional and exceeding expectations".
